# PRD: memo-app

## Executive Summary

A simple, single-user memo application built with Python Flask and SQLite that allows users to create, read, update, and delete personal memos with markdown support and tag-based organization. The application features a clean Bootstrap-powered web interface and JSON export capabilities for local use.

## Problem Statement

Many users need a lightweight, personal note-taking solution that runs locally without the complexity of cloud-based services or heavyweight applications. Current solutions often require internet connectivity, user accounts, or are overly complex for simple memo management. 

This memo app solves the need for:
- Simple local memo storage and management
- Quick note-taking with markdown formatting
- Tag-based organization without complex categorization
- Lightweight solution that runs entirely on the user's machine

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona: Individual Note-Taker
**Profile**: Someone who needs a simple, reliable way to capture and organize personal notes, ideas, and memos locally on their computer.

### Core User Journeys

**Story 1: Creating a New Memo**

- So that I can quickly capture my thoughts and ideas
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - User can enter a title and content in a simple form
  - Content supports markdown formatting
  - User can add tags for organization
  - Creation date is automatically captured
  - Memo is saved to SQLite database

**Story 2: Viewing and Managing Memos**
- As a user, I want to view all my memos in a list
- So that I can quickly find and access my notes
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - All memos are displayed in a clean, organized list
  - Memos show title, creation date, and tags
  - User can click to view full memo content
  - Markdown content is properly rendered

**Story 3: Editing Existing Memos**
- As a user, I want to edit my existing memos
- So that I can update and refine my notes over time
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - User can click edit button on any memo
  - Form is pre-populated with existing data
  - User can modify title, content, and tags
  - Changes are saved to database

**Story 4: Organizing with Tags**
- As a user, I want to tag my memos
- So that I can organize and categorize my notes
- Acceptance Criteria:

  - Tags help identify memo topics at a glance

**Story 5: Exporting Data**
- As a user, I want to export my memos as JSON
- So that I can backup or migrate my data
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Export function generates complete JSON file
  - JSON includes all memo data (title, content, date, tags)
  - File can be downloaded through web interface

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core CRUD Operations**
